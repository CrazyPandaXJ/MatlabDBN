We use the <i>meshgrid()</i> function to create such a grid, as in this example.</p><pre class="codeinput">f = @(x,y) exp(cos(sqrt(x.^2 + y.^2))); <span class="comment">% a function of two variables</span>

Z = f(X,Y);                             <span class="comment">% evaluate f at every point on grid</span>
</pre><p>Some functions, while still vectorized, will only operate on vectors and not matrices. The <i>mvnpdf()</i> function for example interprets a matrix of inputs, (say n-by-d), as n, d-dimensional inputs, not n*d 1-by-1 inputs. We can still plot such functions in 3D with a few small changes. After obtaining X and Y from <i>meshgrid()</i>, save X's size, evaluate f by passing in X and Y as column vectors, (using the : operator), and then reshape the output Z back to the original size and continue as before.</p><pre class="codeinput">[nrows,ncols] = size(X);                <span class="comment">% first obtain the size of X</span>

Z1 = reshape(Z1,nrows,ncols);           <span class="comment">% reshape</span>
</pre><p>There are several 3d plot types available. Here we use <i>surf()</i>, which plots the surface of the function, <i>contourf()</i> , which plots the contour lines of a function and fills the area between them with color, and <i>mesh()</i> , which is similar to <i>surf()</i>, displaying a wire mesh rather than a solid surface. The colors used in each are specified by the current colormap and can be changed by using the <i>colormap()</i> command. Type <b>doc colormap</b> for a list of options. There are several other 3d plotting functions: <i>plot3()</i>  for instance is the 3d generalization of <i>plot()</i>.</p><pre class="codeinput">f4 = figure;                            <span class="comment">% create a new figure</span>

We take advantage of the <i>mat2cell()</i> command to partition the Z data into 21x21 6-by-6 blocks, each block stored within a cell. We then use the <i>cellfun()</i> function to replace each block with its mean. We can use this same technique to apply any function to arbitrary sized blocks of a matrix. Note that when the size of the data within cells is different, 'UniformOutput' must be set to false.</p><pre class="codeinput">f7 = figure;

We can add a title, a legend, labels using <i>xlabel()</i> , <i>ylabel()</i> , and <i>zlabel()</i> , change the range of the axes, the font size, etc.</p><p>3D plotting in Matlab requires a uniform grid of points but the data we obtain from experiments or measurements may not satisfy this constraint. In such cases, we can use the <i>griddata()</i> function to interpolate along a uniform grid of points for us.</p><pre class="codeinput">f8 = figure;

</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="plottingAdvanced_05.png" alt=""> <h2>Annotations and the Plot Editor<a name="11"></a></h2><p>Matlab provides an interactive graphical interface for modifying and inspecting existing figures. This mode can be entered by selecting 'view-&gt;Figure Palette' or by selecting the appropriate shortcut button on the figure toolbar. Here we can add annotations such as text, arrows, and shapes as you would in a program like powerpoint. We can also inspect and change attributes as an alternative to using <i>set()</i> and <i>get()</i> .</p><p>Once you have added elements, you can see the m-code that generates these objects by going to 'File -&gt; Generate M-File'. It is usually easier to add annotations graphically first, generate the m-code and then add the appropriate lines to the original source file so that we can regenerate the complete figure at will. Alternatively, you can save a Matlab figure as a .fig file maintaining all of the graphics object information for future editing.</p><p>We will now add a few annotations to a simple figure. Annotations are placed relative to the figure window, not the axes.  The location is, by default, specified by normalized coordinates between 0 and 1 so that [0.8 0.4] is the point 80% of the width from the left and 40% of the height from the bottom. In the case of a line or an arrow, we specify two x-y pairs, denoting the start and end points. In the case of a text box we specify four numbers, the x and y coordinates followed by the width and height of the box. Type <b>doc annotation</b> for more information. These commands were generated automatically after adding the annotations in the plot editor.</p><pre class="codeinput">f = @(x) x.^2;                  <span class="comment">% create a function of x, namely f(x) = x.^2</span>

</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="plottingAdvanced_06.png" alt=""> <h2>Latex<a name="14"></a></h2><p>Matlab supports the inclusion of both tex and latex markups in figures. This can be useful when you want to include mathematical formulas. For many purposes, simple tex is sufficient. For example, you can write super scripts with the ^ character and subscripts with the _ character, (notice the legend) and include Greek letters using say \alpha or \gamma. To include more complicated latex markups, you have to specify that you want to use the latex interpreter and then surround the mathematical text in $ symbols as shown below. Tex and Latex markups are supported in annotations, legends, and titles but unfortunately not in axis labels via the <i>xlabel()</i> , <i>ylabel()</i> , <i>zlabel()</i> commands or in axis tick labels. If you want to use latex in these locations, you have to add the text manually via annotations.</p><pre class="codeinput">annotation(f3,  <span class="string">'textbox'</span>       , [0.2277 0.6333 0.2081 0.0625]            ,<span class="keyword">...</span>

For instance, perhaps you would like an arrow to point at coordinate (3,4) on your current axes; what point is this relative to the whole figure? <a href="mfiles/graphics/rel2abs.m">rel2abs</a> is a handy function to do this conversion.</p><h2>Multiple figures inside a figure<a name="16"></a></h2><p>Sometimes it can be useful to display multiple sets of axes in a single figure, perhaps to connect them graphically via annotations or just display them next to each other in a compact and convenient way. If we want the axes evenly spaced in a grid, the <i>subplot()</i> command can be useful, but to have more varied and customizable configurations, we have to add the axes manually. To do so, we take advantage of the 'Parent' attribute of the graphics objects. Recall that figures are composed of axes and annotation objects and axes are composed of various plot objects. We will create a new plot and add it along with some of the plots we have already done. The <i>copyobj(h,p)</i> function copies a graphics object with handle h and assigns the new object to parent p.</p><pre class="codeinput">froot = figure;

%% More advanced plotting features
% In this chapter, we discuss some more advanced features.
%% 3D Surface and Contour Plots
% To graph a function of two variables we need to first evaluate that
% function over a grid of points, not just a line as in the 2D case. We use
% the _meshgrid()_ function to create such a grid, as in this example.
%%
f = @(x,y) exp(cos(sqrt(x.^2 + y.^2))); % a function of two variables
d = -2*pi:0.1:2*pi;                     % domain for both x,y
[X,Y] = meshgrid(d,d);                  % create a grid of points
Z = f(X,Y);                             % evaluate f at every point on grid
%%
% Some functions, while still vectorized, will only operate on vectors and
% not matrices. The _mvnpdf()_ function for example interprets a matrix of
% inputs, (say n-by-d), as n, d-dimensional inputs, not n*d 1-by-1 inputs.
% We can still plot such functions in 3D with a few small changes. After
% obtaining X and Y from _meshgrid()_, save X's size, evaluate f by
% passing in X and Y as column vectors, (using the : operator), and then
% reshape the output Z back to the original size and continue as before. 
[nrows,ncols] = size(X);                % first obtain the size of X
Z1 = f(X(:),Y(:));                      % convert X,Y to column vectors and evaluate f
Z1 = reshape(Z1,nrows,ncols);           % reshape
%%
% There are several 3d plot
% types available. Here we use _surf()_, which plots the surface of the
% function, _contourf()_ , which plots the contour lines of a function and
% fills the area between them with color, and _mesh()_ , which is similar
% to _surf()_, displaying a wire mesh rather than a solid surface. The
% colors used in each are specified by the current colormap and can be
% changed by using the _colormap()_ command. Type *doc colormap* for a list
% of options. There are several other 3d plotting functions: _plot3()_  for
% instance is the 3d generalization of _plot()_. 
%%
f4 = figure;                            % create a new figure
p9 = surf(X,Y,Z);                       % plot the surface of the function
shading interp;                         % interpolate between the points  
material dull;                          % alter the reflectance
camlight(90,0);                         % add some light - see doc camlight
alpha(0.8);                             % make slightly transparent
box on;                                 % same as set(gca,'box','on')
%%
f5 = figure;                            % create a new figure
p10 = contourf(X,Y,Z);                  % contour plot
colorbar;                               % add a colorbar
set(gca,'XTick',[],'YTick',[]);         % remove all ticks
%%
f6 = figure;                            % create a new figure
r = 1:3:126;                            % mesh plots look better at lower resolution
p11 = mesh(X(r,r),Y(r,r),Z(r,r));       % plot a mesh grid
view([-15 60]);                         % change the viewing angle - see doc view
colormap Copper;                        % change the colormap
axis off;                               % turn off the axis completely
%%
% Note, the command *view([90,90])* can be very useful to rotate a plot by
% 90 degrees, effectively reversing the locations of the x and y axes. 
%%
% Below we display a 3d bar plot of the same underlying data. We take
% advantage of the _mat2cell()_ command to partition the Z data into 21x21
% 6-by-6 blocks, each block stored within a cell. We then use the
% _cellfun()_ function to replace each block with its mean. We can use this
% same technique to apply any function to arbitrary sized blocks of a
% matrix. Note that when the size of the data within cells is different,
% 'UniformOutput' must be set to false. 
f7 = figure;
grouped = mat2cell(Z,6*ones(21,1),6*ones(21,1)); % partition matrix into 6-by-6 blocks
fconv = @(X)mean(X(:));                          % create function handle
convCell=cellfun(fconv,grouped,...
    'UniformOutput',false);                      % apply that function to every block
convMat = cell2mat(convCell);                    % convert back to a, (smaller) matrix
p12 = bar3(convMat);                             % display a 3d bar plot of the aggregated data
colormap jet                                     % change the color map
%%
% Virtually everything we said about customizing 2D plots applies equally to 3D
% plots. We can add a title, a legend, labels using _xlabel()_ , _ylabel()_
% , and _zlabel()_ , change the range of the axes, the font size, etc. 
%
% 3D plotting in Matlab requires a uniform grid of points but the data we
% obtain from experiments or measurements may not satisfy this
% constraint. In such cases, we can use the _griddata()_ function to
% interpolate along a uniform grid of points for us.
f8 = figure;
randn('state',0);                 % seed the normal random num generator
X = randn(100,50);                % data captured at these points.
Y = randn(100,50);                
Z = cos(X.^2).*exp(X.^2 - Y.^2);  % value of data at these points
d = -1:0.1:1;                     % X,Y range of our data
[XI, YI] = meshgrid(d,d);         % create our grid as before 
ZI = griddata(X,Y,Z,XI,YI);       % interpolate to obtain ZI
p13 = mesh(XI,YI,ZI);             % mesh of the interpolated points
%% Annotations and the Plot Editor
% Matlab provides an interactive graphical interface for modifying and
% inspecting existing figures. This mode can be entered by selecting
% 'view->Figure Palette' or by selecting the appropriate shortcut button on
% the figure toolbar. Here we can add annotations such as text, arrows, and
% shapes as you would in a program like powerpoint. We can also inspect and
% change attributes as an alternative to using _set()_ and _get()_ .
%%
% Once you have added elements, you can see the m-code that generates
% these objects by going to 'File -> Generate M-File'. It is usually easier
% to add annotations graphically first, generate the m-code and then add
% the appropriate lines to the original source file so that we can
% regenerate the complete figure at will. Alternatively, you can save a
% Matlab figure as a .fig file maintaining all of the graphics object
% information for future editing. 
%%
% We will now add a few annotations to a simple figure.
% Annotations are placed relative to the figure window, not the axes.  The
% location is, by default, specified by normalized coordinates between 0
% and 1 so that [0.8 0.4] is the point 80% of the width from the left and
% 40% of the height from the bottom. In the case of a line or an arrow, we
% specify two x-y pairs, denoting the start and end points. In the case of a
% text box we specify four numbers, the x and y coordinates followed by the
% width and height of the box. Type *doc annotation* for more information.
% These commands were generated automatically after adding the annotations
% in the plot editor.
f = @(x) x.^2;                  % create a function of x, namely f(x) = x.^2
g = @(x) 5*sin(x)+5;            % create a second function of x, g(x) = 5*sin(x) + 5
res = 0.001;                    % resolution of the plot
domain = -pi:res:pi;            % the domain of x, (i.e. points at which to evaluate f,g)
f3 = figure('Color',[1,1,1]); hold on;             % new figure with a white background
p5 = plot(domain,f(domain),'REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHr','LineWidth',3);   % plot a thick dashed red line

set(f3,'HandleVisibility','on');
%% Latex
% Matlab supports the inclusion of both tex and latex markups in figures.
% This can be useful when you want to include mathematical formulas. For
% many purposes, simple tex is sufficient. For example, you can write super
% scripts with the ^ character and subscripts with the _ character, (notice
% the legend) and include Greek letters using say \alpha or \gamma. To
% include more complicated latex markups, you have to specify that you want
% to use the latex interpreter and then surround the mathematical text in $
% symbols as shown below. Tex and Latex markups are supported in
% annotations, legends, and titles but unfortunately not in axis labels via
% the _xlabel()_ , _ylabel()_ , _zlabel()_ commands or in axis tick labels.
% If you want to use latex in these locations, you have to add the text
% manually via annotations. 
% 
annotation(f3,  'textbox'       , [0.2277 0.6333 0.2081 0.0625]            ,...
                'Interpreter'   , 'latex'                                  ,...
                'String',{'$M_e = \frac{M_o}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$'},...
                'FontSize'      , 14                                       ,...
                'FitBoxToText'  , 'on'                                     ,...
                'LineStyle'     , 'none');
%% Coordinate Conversion
% Sometimes we would like to specify where an annotation should go relative
% to the current set of axes, rather than relative to the figure window as
% a whole. For instance, perhaps you would like an arrow to point at
% coordinate (3,4) on your current axes; what point is this relative to the
% whole figure? <mfiles/graphics/rel2abs.m rel2abs> is a handy function
% to do this conversion.
%% Multiple figures inside a figure
% Sometimes it can be useful to display multiple sets of axes in a single
% figure, perhaps to connect them graphically via annotations or just
% display them next to each other in a compact and convenient way. If we
% want the axes evenly spaced in a grid, the _subplot()_ command can be
% useful, but to have more varied and customizable configurations, we have
% to add the axes manually. To do so, we take advantage of the 'Parent'
% attribute of the graphics objects. Recall that figures are composed of
% axes and annotation objects and axes are composed of various plot
% objects. We will create a new plot and add it along with some of the
% plots we have already done. The _copyobj(h,p)_ function copies a graphics
% object with handle h and assigns the new object to parent p.
froot = figure;
nr = 3; nc = 3;
sp = 0.05;  % white space around each subfigure in percent
% solve nc*(w+sp)+sp = 1 for w: (1-sp)/nc = w + sp
w = (1-sp)/nr - sp;  % width of each subfigure                                
r = 3; c = 3;
newAx = axes('Parent',froot,'Position', [sp+(c-1)*(w+sp),sp+(r-1)*(w+sp),w,w]); 
imagesc(rand(5,5), 'Parent', newAx);
title(sprintf('r=%d, c=%d ', r, c)); axis off 
figs = [f4, f5, f6, f7, f8];
rows = [1,  1,  1,  2,  2];
cols = [1,  2,  3,  1,  2];
for i=1:length(figs)
  r = rows(i); c = cols(i);
  set(copyobj(gca(figs(i)),froot),'Position', [sp+(c-1)*(w+sp),sp+(r-1)*(w+sp),w,w]);
end

% <html> 
% <A NAME="RootProperties"></A>
% </html>
%% Root Properties
% The top level Matlab graphics object is _root_ and its handle is 0. We
% can access and set the root attributes as we would any other graphics
% handle object using _get(0)_ and _set(0)_. Root's most useful attribute
% is probably 'ScreenSize', which gives the current size, (resolution) of
% the screen in pixels, by default, or in what ever units the 'Units'
% property has been set to. If you work with multiple simultaneous
% monitors, the 'MonitorPositions' attribute is also useful. Here we obtain
% the screen size and demonstrate how to maximize a figure programatically.
set(0,'Units','pixels');                              % set the units to pixels
screenSize = get(0,'ScreenSize')                      % get the monitor resolution
hgap = 5; vgap = 45;
width = screenSize(3)-2*hgap;
height = screenSize(4)-2*vgap;
newPosition = [hgap,vgap,width,height]; 
f = figure('Position',newPosition,'ToolBar','none');  % set the size and position
close(f);                                             % close the figure
%%
% As root is the top level graphics object, we can query it for a list of
% the handles of all of the current figures using the _allchild()_
% function.
handles = allchild(0)'
%%
% Window size defaults and related settings as well as the maximum
% recursion limit is also set here; I suppose for lack of a better place. 
%% Rotating Figures and Creating Movies
% Figures can be rotated or moved with the mouse by first clicking on the
% appropriate shortcut button on a figure window toolbar. However, we can
% also automate and animate the rotation by using the _camorbit()_
% command. 
figure(4);                                  % bring this figure to the foreground. 
axis vis3d                                  % allow for rigid 3d rotation
for i=1:36                                  % change camera angle 36 times
    camorbit(10,0,'camera')                 % 10 degree increments
    pause(0.01);                            % slow it down slightly
end
close(4);                                  
%% 
% We can also create a movie by capturing frames using the _getframe()_
% command and playing them with the _movie()_ function. Alternatively we
% can create an avi file with the _avifile()_ , and _addframe()_ functions. 
% Read their help entries for more information and examples.

%% Creating Graphical User Interfaces
% Matlab has good support for the creation of graphical user interfaces. To
% launch an interactive GUI builder, type *guide* at the command prompt.
% Here, we will only briefly touch on some of the ways in which users can
% interact with figures. To learn more about creating GUIs type *doc guide*
% and click on "Creating GUIs" at the bottom of the help page. 
%% Customizing callback functions when you click on a figure
% As a simple exampl of a GUI, we discuss the _ginput()_ function, which returns a matrix
% of coordinates selected with the mouse. Let's bring up the second plot we
% made, call _ginput()_ and select a few data points to return their
% coordinates. _ginput(n)_ waits for n user clicks before returning the n
% points, whereas _ginput()_ , without any parameters, allows you to
% select any number you like and returns only when the user presses the
% enter key. A similar function, _gtext(txt)_ places the specified string
% at the location selected by the mouse.
%%
%figure(f1);
%C = ginput(5)
%close(f1);
%%
% The above functions operate by assigning a _callback_ function to the
% axes object, which gets executed whenever the user clicks within the
% axes. We can assign our own function to perform whatever action we wish
% when this happens. Most Matlab graphics objects have callback attributes,
% which can be viewed using the _get()_ command and set using _set()_ . 
%% 
% The only constraint on callback functions is that they take 3 or more
% parameters as in myCallback(hObject, eventdata, handles): hObject is the
% object selected, whereas eventdata, and handles differ depending on the
% the callback. For more information, search for _CallBack Syntax and
% Arguments_ in help. 
%% 
% All graphics objects in Matlab also have a 'UserData' attribute, which
% can be assigned any data you like. Since the clicked object is returned
% in hObject, we can retrieve this data with get(hObject,'UserData'). 
%%
% In this simple example, we plot 5 points in 5 different plots and assign
% each plot's 'UserData' attribute a color's name, which we will display
% when clicked. Since this is a simple example, we can create the callback
% inline but in general you should create a stand alone function say
% *function myCallback(hObject,eventData,handles)* and then assign
% @myCallback to the object's callback attribute. We also assign the
% callback to the current axes and figure objects after setting their
% 'UserData' entries to their respective colors. Try out the code for
% yourself.
%%
figure; 
hold all;                                   
name = {'red','blue','green','magenta','cyan'}; 
color = {'.r','.b','.g','.m','.c'};
loc = [(1:5)',2*ones(5,1)];                 
callback = @(hObject,eventData,handles)display(get(hObject,'UserData'));
for i=1:numel(name)             
    plot(loc(i,1),loc(i,2),color{i},...
        'MarkerSize',100,'UserData',name{i},...
        'ButtonDownFcn',callback);
end
axis([0,6,1,3]);
title('click on a colored circle to print its name')
set(gca,'UserData','white')                 % Set the axes user data
set(gca,'XTick',[],'YTick',[],'box','on'); 
set(gca,'ButtonDownFcn',callback);          % assign the callback
set(gcf,'UserData','grey');                 % set the figure user data
set(gcf,'ButtonDownFcn',callback);          % assign the callback
