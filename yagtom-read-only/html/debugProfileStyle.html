</pre><h2>M-lint Warnings &amp; Errors<a name="2"></a></h2><p>Matlab automatically checks for certain problems and suggests fixes as you edit your m-files. The problem code is underlined in red much like word processors underline misspelled words. It is worthwhile paying attention to these as they can often point out problems before you run your code and frequently suggest ways to speed up execution. The suggestions appear when you hover your mouse over the underlined text, and you can quickly find these spots by looking for the red markers to the right of the document. The warnings and errors <i>M-lint</i> warns you about can be set under <i>File-&gt;Preferences-&gt;M-lint</i>.</p><p>In newer versions of Matlab, you can generate a full M-lint html report by going to <i>Tools-&gt;Save and Show M-lint Report</i>. You can also bring up a file dependency report or compare two versions of a file from the Tools drop down menu.</p><h2>Stop! if Errors/Warnings...<a name="4"></a></h2><p>If your program is crashing or displaying cryptic warnings, it is very useful to have it automatically halt execution right at the point where it ran into trouble. Type <b>dbstop if error</b> and <b>dbstop if warning</b>. Or you can use the GUI: Select <i>Debug --&gt; Stop if Errors/Warnings</i> to turn this on, as shown below.</p><p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="stopiferror.png" alt=""> </p><h2>Break Points<a name="6"></a></h2><p>Break points can be set at any line in the document that executes code by pressing just right of the line number. A small circle will appear and will turn red when the file is saved.</p><p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="breakpoint.png" alt=""> </p><p>These can be temporarily disabled by right clicking on them and selecting <i>disable</i>. To clear them all, type <b>dbclear all</b> or press the equivalent tool bar button.</p><p>You can set a condition on the breakpoints so that it is only triggered if a variable takes on a certain value, by right clicking on the variable and selecting 'Set/Modify Condition'.</p><p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="conditionalBreakpoint.png" alt=""> </p><p>Once your code has stopped at a breakpoint, you can step one line at a time, continue on until the next break point, or exit debug mode completely using the tool bar buttons at the top of the editor.</p><p>The <i>step in</i> and <i>step out</i> buttons, let you enter into, or leave a function called at the current line.</p><p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="debugToolbar.png" alt=""> </p><p>There are function equivalents to these commands if you prefer, namely <b>dbstep</b>, <b>dbstep nlines</b>, <b>dbstep in</b>, <b>dbstep out</b>, <b>dbcont</b>, and <b>dbquit</b>. The <i>dbstop()</i> function can be used to set breakpoints and the <i>dbstatus()</i> function displays all of the breakpoints currently set. You can save these into a variable as in <b>s = dbstatus()</b>, clear the breakpoints and then reset them at a later point with <b>dbstop(s)</b>.</p><p>When you are in debug mode, the command window prompt will look slightly different: it will have a <i>k</i> in front.</p><p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="debugprompt.png" alt=""> </p><p>The <i>keyboard()</i> function can also be used to stop execution of a program, temporarily relinquishing control back to the command window. Simply add the line <b>keyboard</b> anywhere in your file to stop at that point. To return execution, type <b>return</b>.</p><h2>Variable Stacks<a name="17"></a></h2><p>Once execution has stopped because of a break point or <i>keyboard()</i> command, you can inspect the current values of the variables by just typing their name, as usual. Or you can open a GUI by typing <b>workspace</b>. Typically functions call other functions, and the variables get pushed on the stack. To change stackframes, use <b>dbup</b> or <b>dbdown</b>, or click the stack bottom on the GUI.</p><p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="debugWorkspace.png" alt=""> </p><p>You can also execute commands at the command prompt while execution has stopped, and assign new values to existing variables.</p><p>
<A NAME="Profiling"></A>
</p><h2>Profiling &amp; Timing Code<a name="21"></a></h2><p>We have already seen the <i>tic()</i> and <i>toc()</i> functions, which can be used to time how long your code takes to run. Simply run <i>tic()</i> before your code and <i>toc()</i> after. Matlab, however, has a much more powerful framework, called profiling, which gives you a detailed report about how long was spent executing each subfunction. You can use this report to find bottlenecks that you might be able to improve.</p><p>You can turn on profiling with the <b>profile on</b> command and turn it off again with <b>profile off</b>. Once profiling is on, execute your code, and then type <b>profile viewer</b> to see the report.</p><p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="profile.png" alt=""> </p><p>The report shows a breakdown of all the functions called from your function, the number of times they were called, and the total time spent executing them. Self-time, denoted by a dark blue band, is the the time spent within a function not including how long was spent in functions called from here. This is really the statistic you should pay attention to. You can click on a function name to bring up its sourcecode.</p><h2>Guidelines on programming style<a name="25"></a></h2><p>Writing your code in a clear fashion can help you find bugs, and makes it easier for other people to read and modify. Programming style, like writing style in general, is something you learn over time, mostly by immitating good examples. There are lots of good books with suggestions on programming style. Some  Matlab-centric advice can be found in Richard Johnson's_ <a href="http://www.datatool.com/downloads/matlab_style_guidelines.pdf">Programming Style Guidelines</a>.

% function is not always easy. 
%
% In this section, we describe a number of tools and techniques that can
% help as well as ways to assess the speed of your code and find potential
% bottlenecks. We finish by discussing a few stylistic points and best
% practices that can make your code more readable and less prone to bugs in
% the first place.
% 
% <html> 
% <A NAME="Debugging"></A>
% </html>
%% Debugging
% Here are some useful functions which we will explain below
%dbstop, dbquit, dbclear, dbstep, dbstep nlines, dbstep in, dbstep out,
%dbcont, dbstatus, keyboard, workspace
%% M-lint Warnings & Errors
% Matlab automatically checks for certain problems and suggests fixes as
% you edit your m-files. The problem code is underlined in red much like
% word processors underline misspelled words. It is worthwhile paying
% attention to these as they can often point out problems before you run
% your code and frequently suggest ways to speed up execution. The
% suggestions appear when you hover your mouse over the underlined text,
% and you can quickly find these spots by looking for the red markers to
% the right of the document. The warnings and errors _M-lint_ warns you
% about can be set under _File->Preferences->M-lint_.
%%
% In newer versions of Matlab, you can generate a full M-lint html report
% by going to _Tools->Save and Show M-lint Report_. You can also bring up a
% file dependency report or compare two versions of a file from the Tools
% drop down menu.
%% Stop! if Errors/Warnings...
% If your program is crashing or displaying cryptic warnings, it is very
% useful to have it automatically halt execution right at the point where
% it ran into trouble. Type *dbstop if error*
% and *dbstop if warning*.
% Or you can use the GUI: Select _Debug REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH> Stop if Errors/Warnings_ to turn
% this on, as shown below.
%%
% <<stopiferror.png>>
%% Break Points 
% Break points can be set at any line in the document that executes code by
% pressing just right of the line number. A small circle will appear and
% will turn red when the file is saved. 
%%
% <<breakpoint.png>>
%%
% These can be temporarily disabled by right clicking on them and selecting
% _disable_. To clear them all, type *dbclear all* or press the equivalent
% tool bar button.
%%
% You can set a condition on the breakpoints so that it is only triggered
% if a variable takes on a certain value, by right clicking on the variable
% and selecting 'Set/Modify Condition'.
%%
% <<conditionalBreakpoint.png>>
%%
% Once your code has stopped at a breakpoint, you can step one line at a
% time, continue on until the next break point, or exit debug mode
% completely using the tool bar buttons at the top of the editor. 
%
% The _step in_ and _step out_ buttons, let you enter into, or leave a
% function called at the current line. 
%%
% <<debugToolbar.png>>
%%
% There are function equivalents to these commands if you prefer, namely
% *dbstep*, *dbstep nlines*, *dbstep in*, *dbstep out*, *dbcont*, and
% *dbquit*. The _dbstop()_ function can be used to set breakpoints and the
% _dbstatus()_ function displays all of the breakpoints currently set. You
% can save these into a variable as in *s = dbstatus()*, clear the
% breakpoints and then reset them at a later point with *dbstop(s)*. 
%%
% When you are in debug mode, the command window prompt will look slightly
% different: it will have a _k_ in front.
%%
% <<debugprompt.png>>
%%
% The _keyboard()_ function can also be used to stop execution of a program,
% temporarily relinquishing control back to the command window. Simply add
% the line *keyboard* anywhere in your file to stop at that point. To
% return execution, type *return*. 
%% Variable Stacks
% Once execution has stopped because of a break point or _keyboard()_
% command, you can inspect the current values of the variables by just typing
% their name, as usual. Or you can open a GUI by typing *workspace*.
% Typically functions call other functions, and the variables get pushed
% on the stack. To change stackframes, use *dbup* or *dbdown*,
% or click the stack bottom on the GUI.
%%
% <<debugWorkspace.png>>
%%
% You can also execute commands at the command prompt while execution has
% stopped, and assign new values to existing variables.

% <A NAME="Profiling"></A>

%% Profiling & Timing Code
% We have already seen the _tic()_ and _toc()_ functions, which can be used
% to time how long your code takes to run. Simply run _tic()_ before your
% code and _toc()_ after. Matlab, however, has a much more powerful
% framework, called profiling, which gives you a detailed report about how
% long was spent executing each subfunction. You can use this report to
% find bottlenecks that you might be able to improve. 
%%
% You can turn on profiling with the *profile on* command and turn it off
% again with *profile off*. Once profiling is on, execute your code, and
% then type *profile viewer* to see the report.
%%
% <<profile.png>>
%%
% The report shows a breakdown of all the functions called from your
% function, the number of times they were called, and the total time spent
% executing them. Self-time, denoted by a dark blue band, is the the time
% spent within a function not including how long was spent in functions
% called from here. This is really the statistic you should pay attention
% to. You can click on a function name to bring up its sourcecode.

% breaking long commands into multiple lines by using ellipses, (...). Keep
% lines to less than say 80 characters long and be consistent throughout. 
%
% Align variables and values by equal signs and commas to show parallel 
% structure, as in this example.
%%
%   plot(Xequal,f(Xequal), 'o' ,'MarkerFaceColor' , 'g'...     
%                              ,'MarkerEdgeColor' , 'k'...

%                              ,'MarkerSize'      , 10);

%   mathematical derivation; for local temporary variables such as loop
%   indices; or when well defined conventions exist. In all of these cases,
%   document their meaning through comments. 
% * Prefix variables denoting a number of elements with the letter _n_ as
%   in _nvalues_ for the number of values. 
% * Suffix variables storing indices with _NDX_ as in dataNDX
% * Use i,j,k for loop variables.
% * Be consistent with pluralization for non-scalar data, i.e. pick one of
%   _value(j)_ or _values(j)_ and use that convention throughout. 
% * Resuse variables names only when the data is related and even then,
%   with caution. It can be very confusing when a variable you have been
%   tracing through a program suddenly changes role.
