##### SOURCE BEGIN #####
%% Matlab editor 
% Matlab is not only a powerful language, but also
% features an excellent Integrated Development Environment,
% including a powerful editor,
% <Debugging.html debugger>, <speedup.html#Profiling profiler>,
% <external.html#mcc compiler>, etc.
% In this chapter, we discuss the editor, which is
% the recommended way to interact with matlab.
%% Editor
% As we mentioned, Matlab commands are executed either at the command
% prompt or by running scripts or functions, which can be created and
% edited with the built in editor. To launch the editor, if it is not
% already open, type *edit* or *edit filename*. Commands can be entered
% here and executed as a script. They are saved with a .m extension. To run
% your script, type in the name at the command prompt, or press *F5* or the
% _save and run_ button at the top of the editor. Your own functions can be
% written here as well, as discussed
% <writingFunctions.html here>.
% You can set break points to halt execution at certain lines for
% debugging, which we discuss <debugging.html#breakpoints here>.
%%
% Here is an image of the editor in action. Notice we have the open m-files
% listed in the center column; you can move these to the left right or
% bottom. We have also _docked_ one of the figures in the top left. By
% default figures open in their own windows but it can sometimes be useful
% to work with a figure on the same screen: to do this, use the _doc
% window_ arrow at the the top left of the figure. 
%%
% <<editor.png>>
%%
% There are many other configuration options and editor tools available;
% experiment by selecting the many buttons and exploring the drop down
% menus.
%%
% <html> 
% <A NAME="cells"></A>
% </html>
%% Cells
% You can partition your code into editor _cells_ by typing two percent
% signs, %%, at the beginning of the line. This can help organize your code
% into logical sections. You can also evaluate cells one at a time by
% selecting the _evaluate cell_ button at the top of the editor. At any
% time, you can execute an arbitrary block of code by highlighting it and
% pressing *F9*. Cells are also used when _publishing_ your code. This
% tutorial was written in Matlab and published to html by selecting the
% _publish_ button at the top of the editor. This can be very useful when
% you want to share your code and results with others in a professional
% looking report. 
%% Code folding
% Certain constructs like for loops and functions can be _folded_, hiding
% all but the top line from view.  Select the + or - symbols appearing
% on the left hand side of the editor, by the line numbers. 
%% Layouts and Other Windows
% Matlab gives you a lot of freedom over how you organize the windows in
% the environment. For instance, you can have have multiple windows take up
% the same screen area and toggle between them at will, or place windows at
% the sides where they automatically hide until you select them. Try
% dragging them around to different places to see the effect. There are
% more windows than described here available under the _Desktop_ drop down
% menu. 
%%
% You can save the current layout, select one of the default ones,
% tile all the windows, and perform many other related tasks under the
% *Desktop* drop down menu. Its worth taking the time to organize your
% layout effectively before you begin working. 
%% Shortcuts
% You can add  shortcut buttons to the toolbar,
% which can be a useful alternative to editing the startup file.
% right click on *Shortcuts* then select *new shortcut*; give
% it a label (name) and enter the commands you want to run
% when you click on it.
%
%% Web browser
% You can read web pages from inside matlab.
% Just type something like
% *web www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/matlabTutorial/html/index.html*.
% This is particularly useful for matlab-generated web pages,
% such as this tutorial. You can execute code by highlighting it on the
% web page and pressing *F9*. The statements are processed as though they
% were typed one at a time in the command window.
%%
% <<matlabTutorialBrowser.png>>
%% Workspace
% All of the current variables, as well as basic information about them,
% can be viewed in a convenient graphical window called the workspace
% (see below). If
% it is not already visible, you can bring it up by typing *workspace* at
% the command prompt or by going to the desktop drop down menu.  You can
% then drag and place it wherever it is convenient. You can set what
% information you want displayed by right clicking on the header bar (with
% "Name Value Class Size Bytes" in the picture below). If you double click on
% a variable it will open it in the variable editor where you can inspect 
% or change its values. 
%%
% <<workspace.png>>
%% Current Directory
% The _current directory_ window, unsurprisingly, displays the files in the
% current working directory. You can open it via the drop down menu
% *Desktop->Current Directory* if it is not already open. From here you can
% navigate the file system and search for files. Type *F5* to force a
% refresh.
