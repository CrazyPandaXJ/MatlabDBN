%% YAGTOM: Yet Another Guide TO Matlab
% By Matthew Dunham, August 2008
%
% Modified by Kevin Murphy, June 2009
%%
% This tutorial covers a number of topics on the Matlab programming
% language and environment, focussing on the features likely to be
% of use to people performing general purpose programming as
% well as data analysis/ statistics/ machine learning.
% In particular, it covers basic features as well as
% some recent additions to the language,
% such as 
% the new (2007a) <speedup.html#bsxfun bsxfun>,
% the new (2008a) <objectOriented.html object oriented programming> interface, 
% the new (2008b) <dataStructures.html#Containers.map containers.map> hash
% table,
% etc.
% Many matlab programmers do not know about these useful features 
% since they are buried deep inside the 
% <http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/index.html official
% documentation>. 
%
% All the code for the examples in this tutorial
% is embedded directly into the document,
% allowing you to easily try it out for yourself as you work your way
% through the tutorial. Most of the code will work on all
% versions of matlab released since 2004 (version 7),
% although some examples require more recent versions.
%
% We have grouped the topics by importance: 'basic' topics are
% essential to all users, 'intermediate' topics are useful to know
% about once you have gained some experience, and 'advanced' topics
% are for experts only and/or of limited interest.
